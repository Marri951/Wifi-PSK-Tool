# Wifi-PSK-Tool
Tool for forgetting Wifi Passkeys that avoids needing to sign into web interface.

There are 3 different versions of this application; all of which are designed to collect separate aspects of network and system information.
There is a revision I'm working on that combines the three. One of which sends its files to a server and/or email address.

This tool and others like it are solely intended as tools for troubleshooting and infrastructure development.
As someone with IT Infrastructure certifications, who is repeatedly asked for troubleshooting help and with friends in similar positions;
these programs were developed to streamline the process.
Here are the tools:
PSK-Tool ~ 

Dta-Find ~ Searches for and records basic system information for Windows 11 devices: username, legal name, pc name (for dns issues), email, and system specs.
            This has been incredibly helpful as people typically don't pay attention when setting up their Windows install and forget the email they used.
            
Send-Rec ~ This is meant as an extractor for the info from the previous 2 tools. It sends this information to Google Drive accounts, emails, and my personal file server.
            Often, this data is sent both to me and whoever the information is coming from (auto-collected from Dta-Find). This tool has proven useful only in situations where
            absolutely necessary as I like to avoid it. A prime example of when it's acceptable to deploy this tool is my first time using it: My mother was having issues getting
            into her Microsoft account, and I used this program to get the email for the account so the password could be reset. 
          
It's imperative to be transparent when using this tool and constantly ensure you have permission to use the tools.
Without such transparency or permission, the use of this tool would be both ethically and morally deplorable.
